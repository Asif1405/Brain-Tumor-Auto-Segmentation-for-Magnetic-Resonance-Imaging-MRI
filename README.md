# Brain-Tumor-Auto-Segmentation-for-Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging-MRI

### Overview:
I built a neural network to automatically segment tumor regions in brain, using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans.

The MRI scan is one of the most common image modalities that we encounter in the radiology field.
Other data modalities include:
- Computer Tomography (CT),
- Ultrasound
- X-Rays.

### Requirements:
Python 3.x

### Packages:

- keras is a framework for building deep learning models.
- keras.backend allows us to perform math operations on tensors.
- nibabel will let us extract the images and labels from the files in our dataset.
- numpy is a library for mathematical and scientific operations.
- pandas is what we'll use to manipulate our data.
